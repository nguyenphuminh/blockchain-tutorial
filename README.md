# Blockchain Tutorial

Here is where you find the source code for [the tutorial series I wrote on dev.to](https://dev.to/freakcdev297/series/15322)

Feel free to use and learn!


## Updated note

There should be some bugs and problems with the implementation shown here, so you should follow my other project - [JeChain](https://github.com/nguyenphuminh/JeChain) for a better blockchain network implementation, it is basically the same thing, but is updated and patched pretty regularly, and has more cool features like smart contracts.
